canaima.aponwaopolicy and canaima.aponwaotheme Buildout Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To install canaima.aponwaopolicy and canaima.aponwaotheme:

* Access to buildout directory
  $ cd src/

* Download from svn:
  $ svn checkout http://plone-ve.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CanaimaAponwao/trunk plone-ve-read-only  

As you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``canaima.aponwaotheme`` and ``canaima.aponwaopolicy`` 
 to the list of eggs and develop to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        canaima.aponwaopolicy
        canaima.aponwaotheme
    ...
    develop =
        src/canaima.aponwaopolicy
        src/canaima.aponwaotheme 
    ...

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        canaima.aponwaopolicy
        canaima.aponwaotheme
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout -o
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
